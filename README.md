A sample utility to control your android phone only using ADB.

* Pros and cons of ADB only:
  * [Pros] **No extra APK installation** is needed.
  * [Pros] Realtime preview (by streaming in h264 with screenrecord)
  * [Cons] Only support simulating **tap** and **swipe** because of the limitation of ```adb shell input```
